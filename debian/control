Description: Determine minimum Perl version of POD directives
 Read a Perl source or pod file and report the minimum Perl version
 needed to process the POD directives used.
 .
 If targetting a particular Perl version this can report on POD
 directives that might only be recognised by later Perl.  There's a
 command line program interface and a module.
